# TestingDjango

Django is a high-level web framework for building web applications using the Python programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the model represents the data, the view represents the user interface, and the controller acts as an intermediary between the two.

Django provides a lot of built-in features such as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database operations, automatic admin interface, URL routing, templating engine, form handling, authentication, and more.

Django is designed to encourage rapid development and follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, which means that developers can write less code to accomplish the same tasks, leading to increased productivity and maintainability.

Overall, Django is a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications, from simple websites to complex web applications with large databases and many users.
